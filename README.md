# Airplane Journey Animation

An animation of a takeoff-to-landing airplane journey with two alternate endings based on the audience's choice.


## Scenario

Once upon a time, at a beautiful and sunny airport, a Kombeng Airlines airplane destined for Tokyo Haneda departed from PPU International Airport at 4:00 PM local time. It passed the Great Wall of China at 8:00 PM local time, then traversed through mountains at 5:00 AM. However, the airplane faced an emergency situation where the pilot had to make a quick decision: whether to fly at a high altitude or a low altitude due to extreme weather conditions.

In this program, if the airplane flies low, it will experience an engine failure, subsequently leading to a crash into a building below. On the other hand, if it flies high, the airplane will successfully navigate through the extreme storm and arrive at Tokyo Haneda at 7:00 AM local time.
